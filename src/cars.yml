# No duplicate keys (car ids, e.g pickup_gray)
# No capital letters in keys!!!
# Keep speed above 0 and below 1 or strange things may happen
# Keep y offset less than 0 and greater than or equal to -1
# Keep side and backwards offsets as negative numbers

# Currently the plugin only supports 53 different cars, this may change in a future update.
# Make sure you do not go over 54 cars if you plan on ignoring the 53 limit, or the plugin will 100% break.
